# CODSOFT
Welcome to my internship project repository at Codsoft! ðŸš€

During my internship, I had the incredible opportunity to work on several AI projects using deep learning techniques in Python. Here are the key projects included:

## TicTacToe AI:
Implementing a TicTacToe game where an AI agent learns to play against human players using minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for optimal move selection.

## Face Recognition AI:
Developing a face recognition system capable of identifying individuals in images and videos using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and techniques like transfer learning with pre-trained models such as VGG or ResNet.

## Image Captioning AI:
Creating an AI model that generates captions for images using a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) like LSTM for sequence generation.

Each project folder contains detailed documentation, including project goals, methodologies, implementation details, and results achieved during the internship. Feel free to explore and learn from the codebase!
